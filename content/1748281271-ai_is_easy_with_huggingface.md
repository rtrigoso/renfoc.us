# AI is Easy with Huggingface
During my most recent job search, I kept seeing AI mentioned everywhere—in job posts, company goals, and interviews—showing just how focused everyone is on AI and machine learning right now. I’m surprised more people aren’t using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), a platform that makes machine learning much easier by offering pre-trained models, especially for language and text. It saves time by skipping the heavy data training, so you can focus on actually building your project. This post will walk any javascript dev through the steps of using prebuilt models on their projects. 
Fun fact: Hugging Face started as a chatbot app before becoming the go-to platform for AI models! It offers [a JavaScript library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface.js/index) that lets you use its machine learning models both on the front end and back end. While there are several alternatives, Hugging Face stands out because it’s well-supported and growing fast—its community has millions of users sharing models and tools, making it one of the most active hubs for AI development today.

## The Pipeline Class
In machine learning, a pipeline is a series of steps that data goes through from raw input to a final prediction or result. Think of it like a factory assembly line, where each station performs a specific task to turn raw materials into a finished product. The data passes through the following steps before returning a resolution:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning: Gather raw data and clean it up, like getting ingredients ready for cooking.
2. Feature Engineering: Pick out or prepare important details from the data, like chopping and seasoning ingredients.
3. Model Training: Teach the model to learn patterns from the data, like a chef cooking a dish.
4. Evaluation: Test the model to see how well it works, like tasting the food before serving.
5. Prediction/Deployment: Use the model to make real predictions, like serving the finished meal to customers.
In the context of Huggingface.js, a pipeline is a ready-to-use, easy tool that handles the whole process of taking input data, running it through a pre-trained machine learning model, and giving you the output—all in one step. 

So what does the pipeline code look like?

```
import { pipeline } from '@huggingface/transformers';
...
export async function SummarizeContent(text) {
    const datasetName = 'Xenova/distilbart-cnn-6-6';
    const summarizer = await pipeline('summarization', datasetName, {
        dtype: 'q8' 
    });
    const res = await summarizer(`summarize: ${text}`);

    return res?.[0]?.summary_text;
}
```

One small note for people testing out the code: dtype stands for data type. It refers to the format used to represent numbers or data inside models and tensors (multi-dimensional arrays). For example, common dtypes include float32 or int64, which specify how numbers are stored in memory.

## Types of Pipelines
In Huggingface, a pipeline type refers to the specific kind of task or use case that a pipeline is designed to handle. Each pipeline type corresponds to a particular machine learning problem, like text classification, translation, or image recognition, and comes with a pre-configured model and processing steps tailored for that task.

Some common pipeline types available to developers in Huggingface include:
- Text Classification: Categorizes text into labels like sentiment analysis (positive/negative).
- Question Answering: Finds answers to questions based on a given text.
- Text Generation: Creates new text based on a prompt, like writing stories or code.
- Translation: Translates text from one language to another.
- Token Classification: Identifies specific parts of text, like named entities (names, places).
- Fill-Mask: Predicts missing words in a sentence.
- Summarization: Creates a short summary of a longer text (the one that we used on the example above).

These pipeline types let developers easily plug in powerful AI features without needing to handle the low-level details of model loading and processing. 

## This is not an Ad
You should definitely give Hugging Face a try! It makes working with AI and machine learning way easier by providing tons of pre-trained models and simple tools you can use right away. Instead of spending weeks or months training models from scratch, Hugging Face lets you jump straight into building your projects and adding smart features like text analysis, translation, or image recognition. Plus, it has a huge, active community and is constantly improving. 
I assure you, incorporating AI skills into your resume is well within your reach.
